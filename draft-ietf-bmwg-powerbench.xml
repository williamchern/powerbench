    <abstract>

   <t>This document defines a standard mechanism to measure, report, and
   compare power usage of different networking devices under different
   network configurations and conditions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
	
   <t>Energy efficiency is becoming increasingly important in the operation
   of network infrastructure. Network devices are typically always on, but
   in some cases, they run at very low average utilization rates. Both network
   utilization and energy consumption of these devices can be improved, 
   and that starts with a normalized characterization <xref target="RFC7460" />.</t>

   <t>The benchmarking methodology defined here will help operators to get
   a more accurate idea of the power drawn by their network and 
   will also help vendors to test the energy efficiency of their devices
   <xref target="RFC6988"/>.</t>

   <t>There is no standard mechanism to benchmark the power utilization 
   of networking devices like routers or switches. 
   <xref target="I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage" /> started to analyze the issue.</t>
   
   <t>This document focuses on the mechanism to correctly characterize and benchmark 
   the energy consumption of networking devices to better  estimate and compare 
   their power usage in order to assess the performance over a set of well-defined scenario.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">   
    <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
    "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14

    they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

    <section title="Aim and Scope">

    <t>Benchmarking can be understood to serve two related but different objectives:<list>
	 <t>Assessing "which system performs best" over a set of well-defined scenarios.</t>
     <t>Measuring the contribution of sub-systems to the overall system's performance
	 (also known as "micro-benchmark").</t>
	</list></t>

    <t>Achieving either objectives requires a well-defined set of principles prescribing
    what must be measured, how must be measured, and which results must be reported. 
    Providing those principles is the objective of this draft.
    These are simply called "the benchmark" in the rest of this draft.</t>

    <t>The benchmark aims to compare the energy efficiency for individual devices 
    (routers and switches belonging to similar device classes).
    In addition, it aims to showcase the effectiveness of various energy optimization 
    techniques for a given device and load type, with the objective of fostering
    improvements in the energy efficiency of future generations of devices.</t>
     </section>
  
     <section title="Replicability and Comparability">

     <t>Replicability is defined as achieving the same results with newly collected data.
     Formally, it is a pre-requisite for benchmarking. Benchmark results are meant to
     be compared, and this comparison is not sound is the individual results are not replicable.</t>

     <t>As discussed later in this draft, replicability in power measurements is complex
     as power is affected by a wide range of parameters, some of which are hard to control 
     e.g., the room temperature.</t>

     <t>Striving for "perfect" replicability would lead to prescribe extremely precisely 
     all the power-impacting factors in the test setup. We argue that this is unrealistic 
     and counter-productive. An overly prescriptive benchmark becomes more complicated to 
     perform. Furthermore, results would then be comparable only across benchmark results
     obtained under the exact same test conditions, which becomes increasingly less likely
     as we prescribe more and more.</t>

     <t>Instead, the benchmark described in this draft proposes to report on a number of
     power-impacting factors, but does not enforce specific values or settings for those.
     The aim is to make the benchmark easier to perform. The comparison between benchmark
     results MAY be somewhat less accurate or fair than with a more prescriptive benchmark, 
     but the hope is to have many more comparison points available, which would ultimately 
     provide a more robust image of the devices power demands and their evolution over time.</t>

     <t>In short: this draft argues it is better to have many benchmark results with 
     a higher uncertainty than a few very precise but hardly comparable ones.</t>

    <section title="Total Weighted Capacity of the interfaces">	
     <t>The total weighted capacity of the interfaces (T) is the weighted sum of all interface throughputs.</t>
	 
     <t>Definition:<list>
				<t>T = B1*T1 +...+ Bi*Ti +...+ Bm*Tm</t>
	 </list></t>

     <t>Discussion:<list>
				<t>Ti is the total capacity of the interfaces for a fixed configuration model and traffic load
				(the sum of the interface bandwidths)</t>
				<t>Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note
                that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1, weight multipliers MAY be specified for router, switch differently,
				3 typical weighted multipliers are 0.1,0.8,0.1)</t>
				<t>m is the number of traffic load levels (if it is considered 100%, 30%, 0%; m = 3) Note that
				traffic load levels MAY be specified differently for router and switch, e.g., traffic level 
				100%,10%,0% for access router, traffic level 100%,30%,0% for core router and data center 
				switch.</t>
     </list></t>
    
	 <t>Measurement units:<list><t>Gbps.</t></list></t>

    <t>Issues<list>
      <t>The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly established a priori.</t>
      <t>It is unclear if the definition of the Ti's is/should be linked to the traffic load levels. 
      For a given port configuration (which MAY result in 50% of the total capacity a device can provide), 
      one MAY be interested in traffic load of e.g., 5% or 10% or the total capacity (not only 50%).</t>

				<t>P = B1*P1 +...+ Bi*Pi +...+ Bm*Pm</t>
	 </list></t>

     <t>Discussion:<list>
				<t>Pi is the Power of the equipment in each traffic load level (e.g. 100%, 30%, 0%)</t>
				<t>Bi is the weighted multiplier for different traffic levels (note that B1+...+Bj+...+Bm = 1)</t>

    <t>Issues:<list>
      <t>The traffic loads and the weighted multipliers need to be clearly established a priori.</t>
      <t>Importantly, the traffic MUST be forwarded of the correct port! 
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and, naturally, we do not want that.
      A tolerance on packet loss and/or forwarding error MUST be specified somehow.  That tolerance could
      be zero for some benchmark problems (e.g., Non packet loss (NDR) estimation), and non-zero for others.
      Tolerating some errors MAY be interesting to navigate the design space of energy saving techniques,
      such as approximate computing/routing. According to measurement procedure in section 6.5 of 
      <xref target="ATIS-0600015.03.2013" />, the Equipment Unit Test (EUT) SHOULD be able to return to full NDR load. 
      Failure to do so disqualifies the test results. </t>

    <section title="Total Power">	
    <t>The total power (Ptot) is the power of the entire equipment, measured as the sum the power drawn 
    by all of the equipment's power supply units.</t>

    <t>Definition:<list>
          <t>Ptot = Pu1 +...+ Pui +...+ Pun</t>

     <t>Discussion:<list>
		  <t>Pui is the power that is drawn by one power supply unit of the equipment</t>

     </list></t>

    <t>Measurement units:<list><t>Watt.</t></list></t>

    <t>Issues:<list>
      <t>The total power depends on many different factors, including the running configuration,
      the number and type of transceiver connected, the forward traffic volume and pattern, 
      the version of the operating system, the room temperature and humidity/other environmental 
      dimensions, the aging of parts, etc. This metric does not allow to compare two equipments against 
      each over, but it MAY be enough to assess the effect of a change on the same equipment; e.g.,
      for optimizing the power draw by changing the running configuration.</t>
	  
      <t>Importantly, the traffic MUST be forwarded of the correct port! 
      It would be easy to cut power down by dropping all traffic, and we of course do not want that.
      A tolerance on packet loss and/or forwarding error MUST be specified somehow. 
      That tolerance could be zero for some benchmark problems, and non-zero for others.

    <section title="Energy Consumption Benchmarking">
	
   <t>The maximum power drawn by a device does not accurately 
   reflect the power under a normal workload.
   Indeed, the energy consumption of a networking device depends on its 
   configuration, connected transceivers, and traffic load. 
   Relying merely on the maximum rated power can overestimate the total
   energy of the networking devices.</t>

   <t>A network device consists of many components, each of which
   draws power (for example, it is possible to mention the power
   draw of the CPU, data forwarding ASIC, memory, fan, etc.).
   Therefore, it is important to formulate a consistent benchmarking
   method for network devices and consider the workload variation 
   and test conditions.</t>

   <t>Enforcing controlled conditions on test conditions (e.g.,
   Temperature) is important for test procedure to make sure test conditions
   repeatable <xref target="RFC6985" />. The measurement condition reported in <xref target="ATIS-0600015.2009" /> 
   and <xref target="ITUT-L.1310" /> SHOULD be applied, e.g., the power measurements SHALL be 
   performed in a laboratory environment under specific range of temperature, 
   humidity and atmosphere pressure.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Test Methodology">	  
	
     <section title="Test Setup">	 	
   <t>The test setup in general is compliant with <xref target="RFC2544" />.
   The Device Under Test (DUT) is connected to a Tester and a Power Meter.
   The Power Meter allows to measure the energy consumption of the device and
   can be used to measure power under various configurations and conditions.
   Tests MUST be done by running one or several of the predefined traffic traces, 
   which are crafted to test different power hungry tasks related to packet processing.
   The Tester is also a traffic generator that enables changing traffic conditions.    
   It is OPTIONAL to choose a non-equal proportion for upstream and downstream traffic.</t>

   <t>It is worth mentioning that the DUT also dissipates significant heat.
   That means that part of the power is used for actual work while the rest
   is dissipated as heat. This heating can lead to more power drawn
   by fans/compressor for cooling the devices. The benchmarking methodology
   does not measure the power drawn by external cooling infrastructure.
   The Power Meter only measures the internal energy consumption of the device.
   Anyway, the device's temperature change MUST be known. It is useful to know 
   whether device's heat management plays a role in the observed differences in 
   energy efficiency and can be correlated to the amount of external power drawn 
   to cool the device.</t>

     </section>  
	 
     <section title="Traffic and Device Characterization">

    <t>The traffic load supported by a device affects its energy consumption.
    Therefore, the benchmark MUST include different traffic loads.</t>
    
    <t>The traffic load MUST specify packet sizes, packet rates, and inter-packet 
    delays, as all MAY affect the energy consumption of network devices <xref target="ATIS-0600015.2009" />.
	To enable replicable and comparable results, the benchmark can specify a set of well-defined
	traffic traces that MUST be used.</t>

    <t>There are different interface types on a network device and the power usage 
    also depends on the kind of connector/transceiver used. 
    The interface type used needs to be specified as well.</t>

    <t> Power measurements SHOULD be performed only after the DUT and the applied traffic condition have reached a stable operating state. Stability in this context refers to the absence of transient effects associated with traffic changes, configuration updates, or device thermal and cooling behavior. </t>

    <t> The stabilization interval, defined as the time between applying a traffic load or configuration and the start of power measurement, MUST be reported. </t>

    <t> The measurement interval, defined as the averaging window over which input power is recorded, and the averaging method used MUST also be reported. </t>

    <t> This methodology does not mandate specific durations for stabilization or measurement intervals, as these MAY depend on device class, implementation, and test environment; however, reporting these intervals is required to support comparability of results. </t>
